1) A company works with number of employees, all the works are dependents on the employees. Even
if one of the employees resign the job immediately then assigned work will be not finished at the
time, so delivery of the project to the clients will be delayed. Company planned to make solution for
this, they want to know which employee may resign next. If they know previously, they can arrange
alternative to avoid such problem. As an AI Engineer you must give Solution to this.


A) How will you achieve this in AI?
B) Find out the 3 -Stage of Problem Identification
C) Name the project
D) Create the dummy Dataset.


How will you achieve this in AI : 

   i) first, collect the information about the employee wellfare based satisfactions like no overtime stuffs, hike, no calls on weekends, number of years in this company.

   ii) use these metrices for recording the actvities of the employees

                 ****


Find out the 3 -Stage of Problem Identification :

    i) since it is talking lot about the data of numbers , consider using Machine Learning
    ii) Super vised Learning, cause we are having each and every information about the behavior of the employee
    iii) Classification, because we are only going to categorize whether they will resign  or not

        conclusion  :
                > Machine Learning
                > Supervised Learning
                > Classification

                                 ****

C) Name the project :

    > Employee Behaviour Prediciton System

D) Create the dummy Dataset.

        >EmployeeID,Age,Department,YearsAtCompany,JobRole,JobSatisfaction(5),PerformanceRating(,MonthlyIncome,OverTime,WorkLifeBalance,will Resign
